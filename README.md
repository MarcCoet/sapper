# @ssgjs/sapper

This is a community fork of [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev) focused on static export needs.

It includes:

- entry-only optional param for export https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper/pull/856
- Handle i/o backpressure with sapper export https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper/pull/869
- (partially merged) Export filter urls by regex https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper/pull/859

We maintain this fork because we feel pain points around sapper static export, and still have hope it is merged upstream oneday.
